<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Good Morning, my name is Shane Homan, and I am the Environmental Systems Support unit's new IT Specialist 5 Application Developer.  I hit the ground at Ecology running, and over the last few years have been the go-to developer for maintaining Water Quality's public web applications for permit data.  I started with bug fixes and small updates, this year I have led development of 2 new electronic permit applications and a new data gathering tool to enable better data analysis and officially start our transition to MVC.  I feel these experiences have more than prepared me for bigger projects working with a bigger team.</p>
<p>As the lead developer for the WQWebPortal, I develop, test, and conduct business analysis and project management for WQ's customer facing system gathering permit applications and data for permit coverage and submission to the EPA.  Portal data is synchronized with PARIS, and I was responsible for updating communications from the old Oracle 2.0 database to the current Microsoft application.  I am trusted to build applications and databases from ideas and scratch, and I take pride in delivering features and products that are efficient, and that customers like to use.  It pains me to leave the WQ IT unit, as I've built up 3 years of experience about water quality, but I know that knowledge will continue to benefit me after moving to ESS and working with the EAP.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to accelerating my career at Ecology with the Environmental Systems Support unit.</p>
