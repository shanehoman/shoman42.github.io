<p>To Whom It May Concern:</p>
<p>Good Morning, my name is Shane Homan, and I am the Infrastructure and Operation section's new IT Specialist 4 Application Developer.  I hit the ground at Ecology running, and over the last few years have been the go-to developer for maintaining Water Quality's public web applications for permit data.  I started with bug fixes and small updates, this year I have led development of 2 new electronic permit applications and a new data gathering tool to enable better data analysis and officially start our transition to MVC.  I feel these experiences have more than prepared me for bigger projects working with a bigger team, and there aren't many customers bigger than all of the agency's web and app development teams.</p>
<p>As the lead developer for the WQWebPortal, I develop, test, and conduct business analysis and project management for WQ's primary customer facing system.  The WQWebPortal gathers permit applications and various data for permit coverage and submission to the EPA.  Portal data is synchronized with PARIS after being signed through CROMERR, and I am responsible for maintaining communications between the Portal and many other Ecology systems.  I am trusted to build applications and databases from ideas and scratch, and I take pride in delivering features and products that are efficient, solve the real problem, and that customers like to use.  It pains me to leave the WQ IT unit after building up 3 years of experience about permits and water quality, but I know that knowledge will continue to benefit me elsewhere at Ecology, especially after moving fully into ITSO and working with the entire agency with INO.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to accelerating my career at Ecology with the Infrastructure and Operation section.</p>
